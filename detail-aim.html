    <h1> Project Description/Aim</h1>
        <p>This project aims to create a chatbot that can be a friendly advisor for RMIT students. This chatbot can assist students, especially newcomers in RMIT, by providing crucial information related to their problem or giving a solution tailored to their current situation. Moreover, students should also be able to feel comfortable when chatting with the chatbot, as if there is also a student behind that chatbot that is helping them. This feeling of comfort will also encourage students to engage more with the chatbot, effectively making the bot act as an advisor or a helpful friend throughout their study at RMIT. This project will aim to solve the unfamiliarity that many freshmen feel when they first start to study at RMIT since many of them just graduated from high school and are inexperienced in studying at an international university. Furthermore, this chatbot will also benefit sophomores and seniors because some of its features are equipped to help students deal with their problems regardless of their year. Botto’s main target users would be incoming freshmen of RMIT and its core feature of providing answers to students’ inquiries about the school will be extensively developed for improved information accuracy and accessibility.</p>
        <p>First, the chatbot needs to be set up with a basic FAQ system that can handle questions regarding information about the school. This is the base of the project since the percentage of customer return will depend on the capability of this function. The more credible and helpful the information provided by the chatbot, the more the students will depend on and use the chatbot. While this feature may seem basic, it will affect the growth of the project as more plans and developments will be based on its performance. In addition, the chatbot will also be of aid for the RMIT Connect as it reduces the amount of work that the staffs have to go through, increasing the efficiency of the workforce and freeing up human resources for more serious problems.</p>
        <p>Second, the chatbot should have high accessibility so students can easily find it and use its service. Our goal is every time the students are met with a dilemma about the school, their first instinct will be to open the chatbot and seek help through it. In addition, by making the chatbot easily accessible to students, the more students are reminded by the chatbot by constantly seeing it during their study, the more students will subconsciously remember it and use it later on. Therefore, not only will the chatbot have its landing page so students can access it, but they will also be able to use the chatbot on Messenger, greatly increasing the accessibility and the exposure of the chatbot.</p>
        <p>Third, students should feel comfortable when using the chatbot, which will lead to a better customer experience. By adding personality into the chatbot, students will find themselves enjoying chatting with it just like they are chatting with their friends, potentially developing a sense of closeness with the bot. This will greatly increase the chance of the students coming back and using the chatbot’s service again. While the main aim of this feature is to increase the customer experience and the percentage of customer return, it can also serve to raise the satisfaction level of students when studying at RMIT. It is undeniable that having a helpful advisor throughout their university years would not only reduce the number of problems they can encounter during their study by taking appropriate advice but also gain a trustworthy friend that they can rely on. </p>
