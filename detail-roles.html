    <h1> Project Description/Roles</h1>
        <p>During our work for this project, while we mainly divided tasks for each member of the group, there are still some specific roles that are taken.</p>
        <p>As our assignments demand a website for us to showcase our work, it is undeniable that there should be both a Website Designer and a Website Developer for our assignments. Our Website Designer and Developer for this project is Thu, who designed the website for both assignments 2 and 3. She was responsible for building the websites from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which she uploaded the code into Github so that everyone from our group can contribute to the content of the websites. Since she had already made a template and guided us on how to change the content on our website, every member from our group was able to easily organize our ideas, reports and contribute content to each part of the website. By having Thu responsible for this role, our group efficiency has increased noticeably since we can focus on finishing other parts of the assignment without worrying about the website.</p>
        <p>As this is an IT project, it is very apparent that there should be a Lead Developer role for this project, which Hoang is in charge of. As a Lead Developer for the project, Hoang is responsible for directing and supervising the development of the chatbot, development, coding, testing, and debugging of the chatbot. Furthermore, because of Hoang's planning and coordination with the team, he was able to give out an effective timeline for our chatbot’s development, helping the group to organize their work efficiently and effectively around the timeline so that everyone could catch up with the deadlines. This ensures the quality of the chatbot while also steadily maintaining the progress of other assignments in the group. </p>
        <p>Just like Sun Tzu said: “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.” (Sun Tzu). Therefore, as a student in a business major, Hoang Anh took the role of a Business Development Manager for this project whose responsibilities were market research and monetization of our project. For our product, Hoang Anh looked into our business’s competitors such as Botify or Walkme to analyze their weaknesses and their strengths, hoping to study and incorporate them into our project. Not only that, she developed a marketing and monetization plan for our chatbot, helping us to make a business model that could intrigue business investors in our final product. These plans and research from Hoang Anh enable us to gain an edge over our competitors or similar start-up projects since we would have a more in-depth insight of the market’s preferences which helps us to have a goal when developing our core features and functions.</p>
        <p>Last but not least, Kien acted as an assistant to support both the development of the website and the chatbot, which may seem insignificant when compared to the above-mentioned roles. However, this role was similarly crucial to the project since it acted as a bridge between the two development teams in our group, helping both sides to fill in the information and draft out any development plan if there was a need for one. Moreover, because of the active collaboration between both departments coming from Kien, Hoang Nguyen and Thu were able to concentrate on their duties and worked on implementing the systems and upgrades for our project, which undoubtedly helped increase our productivity and efficiency.</p>
        <p>As mentioned above, besides these four distinct roles in this group assignment, there is no other specific role that requires a particular member to be responsible for. Because of our scheduled meeting every Sunday and frequent communications between each other in our chat group, we were able to track our assignments’ progress and seek out each other for help in completing tasks that were too much for one person to handle. This method in our group helped us maintain a flexible timeline for us to effectively handle not only this class’s group assignment but also other classes’ assignments, while also guaranteeing the quality of work for each project.</p>
