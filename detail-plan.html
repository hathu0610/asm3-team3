    <h1> Project Description/Plan</h1>
        <h2>Phase 1: the beginning</h2>
            <p>We first met each other through Thu in our first tutorial session for Introduction to Information Technology class, which required us to tell each other about our personal project we wanted to do for this class. Hearing our skills and goals, she acted as an Human Resource personnel and reached out to each of us right after our class through Microsoft Teams, wanting to form a group as soon as possible so that we could spare more time experimenting with this project. The team consisted of Kien, Thu, Hoang, and Hoang Anh, all of which had more or less experiences in working in the IT field except Hoang Anh for she was a business major and decided to take up this class as a way to introduce herself to the IT world. Despite our age gap and unfamiliarity with each other at first, we got along very well with each other in a short period of time, which led to a newly created Messenger group soon filled with intriguing talks and ideas about the paths our project should take and how we should implement it. Since our first interaction with each other through the chat group was such a success that we immediately set up a meeting for this project on that week’s Sunday.</p>
            <p>Before forming this group, Thu had already decided on a general project in her mind, therefore she only recruited people with skills and experiences that would be a great addition to the team and would contribute greatly to the project. Therefore, on the Sunday meeting, despite spending the first half of the meeting introducing ourselves, throughout the meeting, we not only successfully agreed on our main project for this project, which was an AI-powered FAQ chatbot, but also brainstormed innovative features and propose them to each other for further research after that meeting. In addition to the meeting’s success, we decided to hold meetings weekly so that we could report our progress and propose the feasibility of our features after researching throughout the week.</p>
            <p>The initial phase for researching the project continued for two weeks, which provided us with new and intriguing information about the IT world and interesting details about this project. For instance, while looking up data from the the school’s page, we realized the low traffic rate coming from both the Vietnamese and Australian RMIT library throughout 2021 October, only about 2.2% students from RMIT access these pages (100,000 in 4.5 millions students (Similarweb 2021)), which was really strange since most students needed research resources only available in the school library in order to achieve desirable grades. Moreover, as Kien and Hoang were freshmen in the university, there were a lot of questions left unanswered for them since they either did not know a convenient way to seek answers or were hesitant to ask since some of them were common knowledge for RMIT’s students. Furthermore, Kien also mentioned that Dr. Ushik, who was the new lecturer for RMIT starting in the 2021 semester C, also had some troubles familiarizing himself when he first came to RMIT.</p>
            <p>All of those above-mentioned examples helped us believe in the importance of this project while also giving us a clearer objective to achieve for this assignment. Because of these data and researches, we were able to give out concise orders and roles to each member in our group: Kien and Hoang Nguyen were in charge of researching building the chatbot, setting up Github for the project and implementing a method that everyone could easily contribute to the bot’s database, Thu was in charge of building the landing website for the chatbot for its operation and integrating messenger into the website, and last but not least, Hoang Anh, using her acuity in the business field, was responsible for setting up the monetization plan and business ethics for the project.</p>
        <h2>Phase 2: Ideation and the project's framework</h2>
            <p>First and foremost, despite being the most basic function of the chatbot, the FAQ function that provides answers to students’ enquiries was undoubtedly our main focus for this project. Simply because the primary reason why users begin using chatbot and return is for quick information access, other features are presented to further boost user experience. Therefore, as time passed, even if other functions were to be discontinued and scrapped, we would always set this function as our main priority and expand it first. This function would also be paired with the live chat service which connects users with a live personnel with whom they want to receive help from a complex question that was not recorded in the bot’s database. This installment would also ensure our chatbot’s service quality, making sure that every enquiry from our RMIT students is properly handled.</p>
            <p>Next, during our initial three weeks of research, we also looked into our competitors in the chatbot field and what services they offer. For example, Walkme is a powerful digital adoption platform that provides RMIT students with FAQ service and the school with a powerful digital transformation platform (RMIT Canvas n.d). Despite these powerful features, Walkme does not appear to be used frequently by RMIT students, resulting in the low amount of traffic in crucial sites like the school library. All of this happened because of the low visibility that Walkme had on the school’s instructure website since you could only ask for help by clicking the small “? Need Help” button at the corner of the screen. Therefore, one of the directions that we adopted when we were building the chatbot was the high visibility of the bot so that students could easily see and use it. This direction eventually led us to integrate our chatbot into Messenger for convenience and higher accessibility by the students.</p>
            <p>More importantly, one of the problems we encountered when considering the customer engagement and satisfaction from using our service was the flow of the conversation, or to be specific, the chemistry between the bot and the students engaging in a conversation with it. We all agreed that we all felt comfortable when we were talking to our friends, who understood us and could make jokes to make us laugh and keep the conversation interesting. Therefore, we decided to make a personality based on the results of the personality test our group took and gave it to our bot to make it communicate more effectively with the users. While we knew the feasibility of finishing this feature in time for the assignment was very low since the complexity of AI was never something to scoff at and be finished in a month or two, we still decided to include this feature in our slide and essay for we know the importance of its role in our service.</p>
            <p>During our study throughout the semester, we undoubtedly would have to arrange appointments with each other to sort our assignments out and collaborate, which especially would need a quiet environment for a group study session. Hence, the library rooms that are available for booking are ideal candidates for those study sessions. This is why we think that it would be beneficial if the students can use the booking service of the library through our chatbot, saving both the students and the library personnel a lot of time. This function would also be great to be paired with the reminder feature since it could also remind the users about their nearest booking time at the school’s library. We concluded that we can increase the versatility of our chatbot by also making it act as a reminder for us, which would hit two birds with one stone since it could set up a meeting by accessing the outlook calendar and reminding us about the meeting through a single command.</p>
            <p>After all those features related to work and study, we also chose to add a single function that could relieve students’ stress by giving out fun facts about the school, helping to associate the school’s image with not only work but also with enjoyable memories. The bot would give out intriguing facts surrounding the school, either urban legends about the school or fun activities that students could take part in. This not only helped the students generate cherishing moments by taking part in it but also aimed to promote the school’s activities, events.</p>
            <p>And last but not least, after every session of using our chatbot service, there would be a prompt asking students for their feedback about their time using the service. These feedbacks would help us perfect our service and also give the bot extra data to train since we could use those reviews for further training for the bot.</p>
        <h2>Phase 3: Development</h2>
            <p>After spending one more week to develop those ideas mentioned in phase 2 above, we decided to complete the FAQ function first by giving out fun facts and feedback functions since those three are easier to complete in our timeframe for this project.</p>
            <p>After agreeing to the plan, Kien and Hoang teamed up and downloaded RASA for the chatbot’s framework. RASA is an open source AI data training model using the python language and other machine learning libraries like tensorflow, panda to create a semi-AI chatbot. First, Hoang created a doc that contained the “intent” of the chatbot, which were used to determine the intention of the user based on the users’ input’s keywords. Kien then ordered the format of the examples for the intent so that other members from our group would be able to follow and fill in the examples for the bot’s training. Since this task was simple and straightforward, we decided to set the deadline of filling these intents with examples for one week. Thankfully, everyone finished their part in time before the deadline and Hoang successfully set up those intents for the chatbot.</p>
            <p>Since we already had the skeleton of the chatbot readied, Kien and Hoang set up a plan to use Ngrok, a port forwarding service, to transfer our server from our local computers to a cloud server. In addition, all of the data of our chatbot would be saved using mongoDB, which acted similarly like a JSON file. The whole project would then be wrapped by Docker and sent to Heroku to operate on a different cloud server that allowed the chatbot to operate 24/7. Finally, it would end up at Messenger and our landing page through Heroku’s cloud server, making it soon available to be used by RMIT students using Messenger or through our chatbot page.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, despite all of that planning, we did not succeed at setting up an operable server on our local system due an issue with connection from our machine to the Ngrok server. Furthermore, Kien and Hoang were a team of two that just came into contact with RASA and were still very inexperienced when dealing with bugs and unforeseen issues, which resulted in the halt of development and the integration of our chatbot into messenger. Despite the failure in setting up a cloud server, Kien and Hoang managed to save the local server and could operate the chatbot through the command line on the computer, which was later demonstrated to our lecturer during our demo presentation day.</p>
            <p>Currently, as most of our functions were not developed, there was still a long way to go for us to complete our vision of this project. However, we were able to feel optimistic about the project since this proved that we still had a long way to go and there were many more things to learn.</p>
