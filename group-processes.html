    <h1> Group processes</h1>
        <p>The most surprising thing after working together, from the process of planning project ideas until doing the assignment, is great teamwork and good time management skills. Each of us finished personal and group tasks on time as well as caught up on others’ work smoothly throughout the entirety of the project. </p>
        <p>In Assignment 3, the final FAQ Chatbot product named Botto is planned to have various features to support RMIT new students who have questions about RMIT or struggle to find information on the RMIT website. Since the development of the project is based on a framework foreign to all team members, we have not been able to set more ambitious goals for the chatbot. If our team were to improve the project in the future, we would definitely add more in-depth functionalities. Additionally, we would also like to expand Botto’s implementation from solely RMIT to other schools in Vietnam. Turning Botto into a business that provides software as a service undoubtedly requires a more streamlined way to feed and fetch information from the internet and a more detailed plan of implementation which entails team members to be proficient in chatbot development. If we could make changes to our groupwork, we would agree on spending more time developing our knowledge base in chatbot development to be more productive in later development and planning. We are, nonetheless, satisfied with the result of our team’s group work.</p>
        <p>The implementation of IT skills and IT technologies as well as what we have perceived from lectures and tutorial class will be displayed in this project. This IT project is useful and creative practical experience assisting us in the future application of technology in our career path.</p>
