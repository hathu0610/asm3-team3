    <h1> Overview/Landscape</h1>
    <p>The unique feature of Botto is the way it expresses the style and attitude through responding to messages based on our team’s personality through the test in specific and RMIT students’ characteristics in general. Botsify services, and Walk me are potential competitors to Botto.
    </p>
    <p>Firstly is the Botsify services, the similarity between Botto and Botsify is the multiplatform, multimedia for an interactive conversation, and human help feature that is provided. Botsify is currently the best chatbot service that is fully managed in Viet Nam and compared to Botto, the highlight of the Botify Chatbot is the multiple languages its offers as well as the extra functions including analytics and reporting, google sheet integration and be able to send data to Zapier webhook which put the lead in CRM instantly that not consist in Botto (Botify 2021). However, Botto is a free platform offering for RMIT students while $1490 per year will be charged if RMIT decided to go for Botsify service. The other difference is Botto focuses on education and information but Botsify is a business-oriented type which is what RMIT can consider.

    <p>Secondly, the digital adoption platform that is already used in RMIT Canvas FAQ in the “Need help” session to support RMIT students with questions relating to Canvas or assist with any technical issues is powered by Walk me (RMIT Canvas n.d). In this FAQ, the features are divided into 3 main parts, the technical support or report any problems that occur will be consisted in the “Canvas Help” part, the instructions on how to use Canvas for the first users such as Navigation Tour or set up profile picture will be included in the “Basic and Settings” session and the set of questions for Canvas tools like the way to submit assignment will be provided in the “RMIT FAQs” (Figure 1). The similarity of Botto and Walk me is the variety of platforms and also the multimedia that converts to live conversation. The difference between Walk me to Botto is the streamlined HR processes assisting RMIT students who want to work on campus with performing exit interviews or payroll questions (Walk me 2021). According to Walk me (2021), Walk me FAQs are triggered by Launchers which this type of platform can be placed everywhere on the RMIT websites in the “Help” session while Botto is a based website platform linking with the Facebook Messenger Plugin. The CRM of Walk me is also more efficient and stable than Botto that not only reduces errors but also benefits when creating, editing leads, or project tasks (Walk me 2021).
