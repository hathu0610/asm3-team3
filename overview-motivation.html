    <h1> Overview/Motivation</h1>
        <p>Data in Similarweb (2021) showed that RMIT Library visitors are lower than RMIT Canvas visitors even though sources to research for RMIT’s assignment in the Library is much more diverse. 4.5 million users connected to RMIT Canvas last month which mean almost 150 thousand users access per day (Similarweb 2021) compared to the data reported by RMIT Vietnam website (RMIT Library-Vietnam) and Australian website (RMIT Library-Australia) of under 100 thousand users access to RMIT’s library per day (Similarweb 2021). One of the reasons leading to the low volume of RMIT library access is its guideline in the website; it is not suitable and detailed enough for some users, which is why our original idea was to create Botto that makes accessing library materials more convenient. We extend that idea and settle on a smart FAQ Chatbot that is the reception center of students' inquiries regarding enrollment, return to campus, campus facilities, library services, events, and canvas study portal.</p>
        <p>Three of our team members are in their first semester at RMIT so they understand the topics of concern raised by RMIT’s new students better than anyone else. Straightforward, simple questions are brought up before the semester starts, then, their level of curiosity and requests for extra information about the university increase later during the first semester. Their concerns are often about the facilities, events, and the vast services that RMIT offer. It is during such times when they are unfamiliar with the new environment that this 24/7 chatbot will be of invaluable assistance for them to explore RMIT. Education is not the only field that uses the FAQ Chatbot to provide service quality but also many big organizations such as Amazon or Microsoft also use AI Technology to improve the quality of customers and services responding 24/7. In fact, AI is in the top 10 latest of IT trends that are used wisely and began the implementation on a larger scale which is only set to grow more over the coming years (BMC 2021). In the rise of such revolutionary technologies, we all decided to make our chatbot an AI-powered tool that learns and adapts. Thanks to Rasa, a chatbot-making framework, we have already had a headstart in giving Botto the ability to improve itself over time. </p>
        <p>As creators of Botto, when future employers evaluate and see our work, these qualities of ours will stand out to them: work ethics, leadership, creativity, and advanced technical knowledge. Our original idea was an RMIT Library chatbot, but we aspired for a much more complex chatbot and it might not seem achievable in such short time. However, we believe that we could progress in time as all members were passionately willing to commit more of their time into developing Botto. It is undoubtedly true that employers around the world are seeking candidates who are such goal-oriented and determined in doing their jobs. Work ethics indicate leadership as well, not only were we responsible for supporting each other, we were our own leaders who pushed ourselves to produce quality work on time. We were able to agree on the idea of a chatbot and expand on that idea so quickly because every member can put forth a plethora of innovative points to support an idea. We were willing to voice our opinions and not hesitant to complement others. Since creating a chatbot is a rather complex process, if we could produce a successful product, we would unequivocally accumulate deep technical knowledge in the process, which we believe would suffice to impress the most demanding employers.</p>
