    <h1> Overview/Motivation</h1>
    <p>The data in the Similarweb (2021) showed that the RMIT Library visitors are lower than RMIT Canvas visitors even though the number of sources to research for RMIT’s assignment in the Library is higher. 4.5 million users connected to Rmit Canvas last month which mean almost 150 thousand users accessed daily (Similarweb 2021) while the data reported by RMIT Vietnam website (RMIT Library-Vietnam) and Australian website (RMIT Library-Australia) is under 100 thousand users assessed to RMIT’s library (Similarweb 2021). One of the reasons leading to the low volume in RMIT library access is the guideline in the website is not suitable and detailed enough for some users, which is why Botto - our FAQ Chatbot can improve and solve this important issue.

    <p>Almost all of the members in our group are in the first semester studying at RMIT so they understand the obstacles and the number of questions that are raised for RMIT’s new students will be more than current students. Regular questions are specially brought up more before the school starts out of the curiosity and the expectation for extra information to know more about the university studying environment and what is school provides under the high tuition and fee. Each new student will experience the peak period of asking questions when they just get into school as everything is not familiar to them. Education is not the only field that uses the FAQ Chatbot to provide a better quality of services for students but also many big organizations such as Amazon or Microsoft also use AI Technology to improve the quality of customers and services responding 24/7. In fact, AI is in the top 10 latest of IT trends that are used wisely and began the implementation on a larger scale which is only set to grow more over the coming years (BMC 2021). As a result, for a future employer, this project will be the best platform to enhance the quality of customer services as well as reduce labor costs.
