    <h1> Project Description/Testing</h1>
        <p>Because Botto is a rule-based chatbot enhanced by Natural Language Processing, thorough behavior testing and correcting is compulsory for the success of this project.</p>
        <p>In order for the Rasa NLU to show its full capabilities, Botto team must provide a large, diverse dataset consisting of NLU examples so that it can effectively extract user’s intents and entities when asking for Botto’s assistance. To test the functionality of Botto, which is primarily directed to provide support for new RMIT students, our team needs to arrange group testing with people in the age range of 18 - 25 to best simulate the intended target users. This group of people should be university-level or are prospective students of universities throughout Hanoi. The outcomes of those group testings will bring our team a great deal of valuble insights from users to promote Botto's accuracy and functionaliy. Aside  from group testing, Botto team will conduct weekly internal product test to ensure that the product has reached the desired milestones. Since Rasa NLU allows developers to improve its NLP accuracy just by talking and correcting chatbot behaviors, those weekly meeting times will also be used to train the chatbot.</p>
