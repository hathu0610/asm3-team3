    <h1> Project Description/Scope</h1>
        <p>Since we only have 16 weeks available for the development of this project, the scope is also very concentrated. </p>
        <p>The main objective of the project is to deliver a complete chatbot that presents Frequently Asked Questions answers to RMIT students in the most convenient fashion within 3 months of development. This chatbot should break down or summarize information from RMIT’s official sites and cater to most of users' questions that are covered by RMIT's public contents. As a part of our plan to make the chatbot a convenient and engaging experience for users, Botto will be deployed on a 24/7 server and fully integrated to Messenger by the end of the second month. After the second month, the chatbot is aimed to gain 1000 user interactions.</p>
        <p>Even though Botto is fundamentally an FAQ chatbot, it covers more topics than the FAQ section of RMIT website. The 6 question topics included are: enrollment, return to campus, campus facilities, library services, activities and events, and canvas study portal. These topics are vast but we would expect that they are completed after the first month and a half and well-tested after two months. Extra features – setting reminders, checking room availability, showing funfacts – will be developed and finished by the 10th week. The rest of the development process is used to test run customizations for other schools other than RMIT so expand the usage of Botto. </p>
        <p>Botto can answer FAQs with the information that is official and is open to public only. This means that Botto will not be fetching data from any other resources outside of RMIT. After extracting users' intents and entities, Botto will create a summary of that set of information to provide an insight to developers so that they see chatbot's performance and common usage, but it will not disclose anyone's detailed information if not permitted. </p>
        <p>The Botto team will experience limited developing time, making it harder to test and perfect the chatbot. Especially because we are new to the programming framework, a considerable amount of time will be devoted to debugging and learning. Another constraint is that if the school does not have an API for other programs to interact with, it will take even longer for us developers to develop the project.</p>
