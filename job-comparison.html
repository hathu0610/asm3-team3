<h1>Team Profile</h1>
    <h2>Team name explanation</h2>
    <p>Our team’s name is CFOB which C stands for creative, F – friendly, O – organized and B is the first letter of our product name – Botto. This name is the combination of our mutual characteristics, working style, and the name of our AI-powered FAQ Chatbot. In our group, Hoang Anh’s business-oriented ideas amalgamated with the other three technology enthusiasts' views sparked inventive and captivating ideas for the project. We work with a friendly, polite, and professional attitude so we aim to instill in Botto those similar qualities which align perfectly with RMIT students' expectations of a good companion.</p>
    <p>Our team always attempted to have deadlines, meetings, and groupwork well-organized to ensure optimal results from the project. These meticulous decision-making, strategy-planning, communicating, time-managing skills and the ability to work under pressure during each assignment not only benefit us within the scope of this project but for our future careers as well. We were actively finding each other during online session and forming a team immediately after the first meet-and-great, earlier than many others groups and finalized the project ideas at the end of week 1. This is proof of our team chemistry and spirits since the very beginning. </p>
    <p>Botto is a suitable name for our project. “Botto," its pronunciation directly suggests an association with robot, automation but still exudes traits of friendliness and cordiality. We unanimously agreed to combine all 4 elements as the group name to both celebrate the results we have achieved as a group and remind us to keep thriving and contributing in such manners. </p>

    <h2> Job Comparison</h2>
    <p>It is clear that each team member has a different future goal from another, but the common factor that stands out in all of our jobs is their technology aspect. Barring Hoang whose ideal job is entirely focused on technical IT skills , the other members also strives for jobs that handle technologies on a daily basis. Their positions do not necessitate them to be directly involved in software development, they do still have to reach a high level of technology mastery in order to accomplish their tasks well. Moreover, since all members take positions that underscore their ability to introduce strategies and visions for their companies, it is inevitable that they need to possess a profound understanding of technologies, resource, and time limitations to present feasible ideas. It is, thus, agreed on that the more technical knowledge that we accumulate, the better we can perform in the workplace. </p>
    <p>Even though all four members' ideal job positions bear some resemblance to one another, the main skillsets required to fulfill each job are noticeably different. Hoang Anh decides to take on a business managerial role at Microsoft. It is shown on her personality test that she is detail-oriented and has a keen ability to do in-depth market research in business, which is a big advantage in her field. However, Hoang, a Machine Learning Engineer to-be, does not have to refine those business skills as he chiefly needs to channel his focus on software development and Artificial Intelligence to research and apply at VinBrain. Kien also has to develop a really good technical base, but compared to Hoang, his technical base does not cover as much in-depth knowledge but is wider. His position at TPBank will need him to update and assess the latest technologies with the end goal of bringing about new, fruitful technologies to offer customers. Thu wants to embrace a managerial job position at Tiki. Her job allows her to take advantage of her exceptional analytical thinking and communicative skills when providing project visions and exchanging information stakeholders. Thanks to the fact that all team members possess and seek to promote unique sets of skills, we work in harmony and complements each other’s work during this project.</p>
    <p>According to the personality tests, Hoang and Hoang Anh would always prefer structured, coherent working schedule. They both want set dates and deadlines for work milestones. In constrast, Thu and Kien tend to be dynamic workers who are most productive when they get inspired by new ideas. Conflicting as it may sound, these four work well together. Kien and Thu are in charge of adding innovative elements to the project and the other two ensure work progress. Because Kien and Hoang’s future plans demand significant technical background, the two are often time allocated tasks to work together for a productivity boost and opportunities to learn from eachother. Similarly, Hoang Anh and Thu work closely together both because they share a lot of common personality traits and that they aspire similar project managing jobs. Their work are, therefore, very well-crafted and on-time. </p>

    <h2> Group processes</h2>
    <p>The most surprising thing after working together, from the process of planning project ideas until doing the assignment, is great teamwork and good time management skills. Each of us finished personal and group tasks on time as well as caught up on others’ work smoothly throughout the entirety of the project. </p>
    <p>In Assignment 3, the final FAQ Chatbot product named Botto is planned to have various features to support RMIT new students who have questions about RMIT or struggle to find information on the RMIT website. Since the development of the project is based on a framework foreign to all team members, we have not been able to set more ambitious goals for the chatbot. If our team were to improve the project in the future, we would definitely add more in-depth functionalities. Additionally, we would also like to expand Botto’s implementation from solely RMIT to other schools in Vietnam. Turning Botto into a business that provides software as a service undoubtedly requires a more streamlined way to feed and fetch information from the internet and a more detailed plan of implementation which entails team members to be proficient in chatbot development. If we could make changes to our groupwork, we would agree on spending more time developing our knowledge base in chatbot development to be more productive in later development and planning. We are, nonetheless, satisfied with the result of our team’s group work.</p>
    <p>The implementation of IT skills and IT technologies as well as what we have perceived from lectures and tutorial class will be displayed in this project. This IT project is useful and creative practical experience assisting us in the future application of technology in our career path.</p>
