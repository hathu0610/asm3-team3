    <h1> Job Comparison</h1>
        <p>It is clear that each team member has a different future goal from another, but the common factor that stands out in all of our jobs is their technology aspect. Barring Hoang whose ideal job is entirely focused on technical IT skills , the other members also strives for jobs that handle technologies on a daily basis. Their positions do not necessitate them to be directly involved in software development, they do still have to reach a high level of technology mastery in order to accomplish their tasks well. Moreover, since all members take positions that underscore their ability to introduce strategies and visions for their companies, it is inevitable that they need to possess a profound understanding of technologies, resource, and time limitations to present feasible ideas. It is, thus, agreed on that the more technical knowledge that we accumulate, the better we can perform in the workplace. </p>
        <p>Even though all four members' ideal job positions bear some resemblance to one another, the main skillsets required to fulfill each job are noticeably different. Hoang Anh decides to take on a business managerial role at Microsoft. It is shown on her personality test that she is detail-oriented and has a keen ability to do in-depth market research in business, which is a big advantage in her field. However, Hoang, a Machine Learning Engineer to-be, does not have to refine those business skills as he chiefly needs to channel his focus on software development and Artificial Intelligence to research and apply at VinBrain. Kien also has to develop a really good technical base, but compared to Hoang, his technical base does not cover as much in-depth knowledge but is wider. His position at TPBank will need him to update and assess the latest technologies with the end goal of bringing about new, fruitful technologies to offer customers. Thu wants to embrace a managerial job position at Tiki. Her job allows her to take advantage of her exceptional analytical thinking and communicative skills when providing project visions and exchanging information stakeholders. Thanks to the fact that all team members possess and seek to promote unique sets of skills, we work in harmony and complements each other’s work during this project.</p>
        <p>According to the personality tests, Hoang and Hoang Anh would always prefer structured, coherent working schedule. They both want set dates and deadlines for work milestones. In constrast, Thu and Kien tend to be dynamic workers who are most productive when they get inspired by new ideas. Conflicting as it may sound, these four work well together. Kien and Thu are in charge of adding innovative elements to the project and the other two ensure work progress. Because Kien and Hoang’s future plans demand significant technical background, the two are often time allocated tasks to work together for a productivity boost and opportunities to learn from eachother. Similarly, Hoang Anh and Thu work closely together both because they share a lot of common personality traits and that they aspire similar project managing jobs. Their work are, therefore, very well-crafted and on-time. </p>
