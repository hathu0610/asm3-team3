    <h1> Team Profile/Kien Bui</h1>
    <h3>1/ Personal Information</h3>
    <p>My name is Bui Quang Kien and my student id is S3928848. My passion for information technology can be attributed to my father, who had a profound impact on my life and introduced me to the world of technology. Ever since my father taught me about the infinite potential of technology, I have studied programming and worked on small projects for the developer community of some games. I am currently taking the time to learn and program in Python to help create my little ambition, a virtual personal assistant. In fact, I have recently been able to write a simple chatbot using Python that takes a simple order and serves a simple coffee shop. Despite my extensive experience in information technology, my interests are not limited to technology, since I have a deep passion for the arts and basketball as well. In fact, before applying to the Department of Information and Communication Engineering, I thought about whether to enter the art world. However, I decided to push aside my passion and creativity in the arts and instead use that passion to further support my path to becoming an IT professional. I am also convinced that studying at RMIT, this unique international environment will enable me to progress in many directions that I never even thought of.</p>

    <h3>2/ Career plan</h3>
    <p>My future goal is to be the head of technology and transformation at TP bank. There, it is my responsibility to propose creative solutions and introduce new and innovative technologies to the company. I'm thrilled to be able to use new technologies such as big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to inspire creativity in the technological advancement of the banking industry. In addition, by reaching that role in the company, I'm going to meet more people with innovative thinking and work with them, further improving myself in terms of my own IT field.</p>
