    <h1> Project Description/Group Processes</h1>
    <p>Communication is undoubtedly one of the most vital aspects when creating a project. As a result, our team develops a set of protocols for communication. Our communication is a combination of Facebook Messenger, Google Docs, and in-person meetings. We use each communication medium for different purposes. For important discussions and assessments of progress, we hold face-to-face meetings or video calls. For quick updates and errors reports, we usually communicate via Facebook Messenger because team members can respond quickly to help resolve the issues. We typically use Google Docs to document deadlines and current processes in order to agree on deadlines and goal alignments. As regards to the frequency of our communication, we usually have two meetings per week. To minimize communication issues between team members we set ground rules for each issue. If a team member does not complete a task and does not communicate with others for a week, our team leader Hoang Anh will state the problem and explain how it affects other team members. If the team member still does not cooperate, the team leader will report the situation to the teacher. All the team members are required to join a meeting, and so if one member canâ€™t join, our team will reschedule the meeting or take meeting notes for that team member to catch up.
