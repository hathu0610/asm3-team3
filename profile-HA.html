    <h1> Team Profile/ Hoang Anh Nguyen</h1>
    <h3>1/ Personal Information</h3>
    <p>I am Hoang Anh(s3877181), currently an RMIT business student. I used to study abroad and work in the US for around 3 years and achieve an associate of business degree, but due to the outbreak of Covid in my living area, I decided to come back to Vietnam and study International Business at RMIT. I only have to study one more semester to earn my degree. It has been a righteous decision to continue my path of study at RMIT because in this international environment, I was be able to experience, learn, and apply my knowledge to different business aspects. The most fruitful experience when studying here has been the chance to be a Human Resource Executive in RMIT Tourism and Hospitality Club. Not only did I meet many new friends but I also gained various soft skills as a club executive. My hobby is traveling and in THM Club, I thrive in many bonding trips, and the people in here are like my second family. Everyone supports each other and no one is left behind when engaged in this community. Since for half of the required courses, I transfer the my previous credit from the US, I do not have to take as many classes in order to graduate. This is why for General Elective classs, I target the courses that I am genuinely interested in to take and one of them is Introduction to Information Technology. Having basic IT skills is a strong stepping stone for my future career endeavors. Another reason why I decided to take this course was due to the intrusion of virus blackmail on my laptop 5 months ago that damaged all data in my C drive, I believe that this course will help me protect myself by becoming more aware of the IT threats out there. </p>
    <h3>2/ Career plan</h3>
    <p>I want to challenge myself with a business program manager position at Microsoft after graduating from RMIT. This position is the application of the methodology to process management, planning, and building project ideas to provide products, services, and technologies to customers. This attractive position is commit to the strategic level of technological improvement and development, the requirements for professional and comprehensive communication with internal companies and customers, as well as the creation of concrete trust and reputation through partnerships during the work programs. At Microsoft, I believe in being the best, and the combination of both Business and IT excites me about the journey ahead, providing a diverse working environment as well as a  place conducive to skill development.</p>
