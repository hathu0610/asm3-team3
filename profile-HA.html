    <h1> Team Profile/ Hoang Anh Nguyen</h1>
    <h3>1/ Personal Information</h3>
    <p>I used to learn abroad and work in the US for around 3 years and achieve an associate of business degree, but due to the outbreak of Covid in my living area, I decided to come back to Vietnam and study International Business at RMIT. I only have to study one more semester to achieve my degree and my student ID is s3877181. It is my right decision to continue my path of study at RMIT as in the international environment, I would be able to experience, learn and expose my knowledge in different angles of the business field even my major is International Business. The most meaningful and useful experience when studying here is the chance to be a Human Resource Executive in RMIT Tourism and Hospitality Club. I not only meet many new friends but also gain various soft skills when in charge of the executive position. My hobby is traveling and in THM Club, I thrive in many bonding trips, and the people in here like my second family as everyone supports each other and no one is left behind when engaged in this community. Since half of the required course, I transfer the credit from the US to here so I do not have many classes left to graduate. That is why for GE class, I target the course that I am interested in to take and one of them is IT. Having basic IT skills is bright support for my future career position and also due to the intrusion of num virus blackmail on my laptop 5 months ago that damaged all data in my C drive, taking IT course is a great option to help me solve the virus incursion when it occurs one more time. </p>
    <h3>2/ Career plan</h3>
    <p>I want to challenge myself with a business program manager position at Microsoft after graduating from RMIT. This position is the application of the methodology to process management, planning, and building project ideas to provide products, services, and technologies to customers. This attractive position is commit to the strategic level of technological improvement and development, the requirements for professional and comprehensive communication with internal companies and customers, as well as the creation of concrete trust and reputation through partnerships during the work programs. At Microsoft, I believe in being the best, and the combination of both Business and IT excites me about the journey ahead, providing a diverse working environment as well as a  place conducive to skill development.</p>
