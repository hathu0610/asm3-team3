    <h1> Team Profile/ Thu Nguyen</h1>
    <h3>1/ Personal Information</h3>
    <p>My name is Nguyen Thi Ha Thu (s3927104) and I am a first year student at RMIT Vietnam. My technical path began when I first entered an American university and majored in Economics. When I took my foundation class, I studied Computer Science 101 and met a teacher who had a deep passion for technology and wanted to pass on his passion to his students. He saw programming as a "puzzle" and us programmers were the "detectives" needed to solve that riddle. In the summer of my sophomore year, I was lucky enough to get a job at a game studio, where I worked as a game developer trainee. I had a wonderful experience with the team and was mentored by a dedicated technical leader. As I did not feel rewarding to work as a developer, I decided to take a year off from school. Back in Vietnam, I found a suitable job that combined my passion for technology and analytical/operations skills, which is being a product owner for an e-commerce company. As my job is heavily required to work between developers, designers, and business teams, I find that my lack of technical knowledge has created a rift between me and the technical team. I decided to continue my studies at RMIT because RMIT offers the best education with an English-speaking environment. I believe that RMIT will prepare me with enough knowledge for my future work and inform how technology will change in the future.

    <h3>2/ Career plan</h3>
    <p>Tiki's product manager is a position that I hope for in the future. Ideal candidates for this job should have a customer-centric mindset, a good understanding of front-end and back-end programming languages, and the ability to design, analyze, and improve financial products using big data. Since a product manager will be dealing with different stakeholders, the candidate must have strong analytical, organizational, and communication skills. It is a customer-centric position that transforms consumer needs into an online financial product perspective.
