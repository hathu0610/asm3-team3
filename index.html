      <p>As in Assignment 2, you need to have a group website and a GitHub (or similar) repository for your group.
        In your report, you should include a brief description of what you have done, and include the following
        The link to your group’s website
        The link to your group’s Git repository (GitHub, BitBucket, etc.)
        Your comments on how well the audit trail on the Git repository reflects your group’s work. You will presumably only be able to do this close to the time of submission.

We come up with the project ideas after forming the group in week 1 and due to the variety of ideas, during the third meeting for assignment 2 preparing for assignment 3, we experienced miscommunication in deciding how many examples we should write in the project’s motivation and the detailed description of Botto including Botto features will be put in assignment 2 or assignment 3. This miscommunication was solved right after I told them to make a clear objective in each part before doing it since assignment 2 is about the project ideas in general, assignment 3 will go more deeply into the process of making Chatbot, followed by the skills, tools, and technology that applied. The purpose of this project is to assist RMIT new students with questions through Botto and Github log of activity has reflected our group’s work on this assignment as when we tested asking Botto about specific questions like “How many clubs that RMIT have?”, Botto can respond and refer the link to the correct RMIT website that consists the answer for that question through Facebook messenger plugin.</p>

            <h3>2/ Nhat Hoang Nguyen's Reflection</h3>
            <p>I believe that we have done exceptionally well as a team as we were able to collaborate effectively and truthfully self-reflect. My team never ceased to amaze me with their diligent working style and supportive attitude. I have received much help and guidance from them throughout the development of this project and I feel great being able to voice my constructive feedback to people who always aspire to be the better versions of themselves. Though I am very satisfied with the group collaboration and final report, I still want to do a few things differently. As I am always excited to discover and learn new skills, I chose to go into chatbot development, a field that I am not familiar with using sets of skills that I am still improving. This resulted in an incomplete demonstration of a chatbot, which is the root of my regret. If I could restart the project, I would select a simpler project and devote more time refining the final product as opposed to entering completely foreign territories. I think that my GitHub audit trail reflects well on my dedication to the project. The majority of my commits were on the very last week since I needed to review and finalize the report’s materials before uploading it into our group’s website. The Github log, however, does not reflect the effort of Kien and Hoang Anh as well as they deserve; this is because they spent a lot of time preparing content and planning that facilitated my job and Thu’s job.
            </p>
            <h3>3/ Kien Bui's Reflection</h3>
            <p>I am really satisfied with the quality of my group for this semester as we all had a great time collaborating and also produced an excellent final product for this course. As far as I can say, Thu did a great job at recruiting members for her team since everyone in this group instantly got on well with each other like a house on fire. What surprised me initially was that everyone in this group was older than me as either they had gap years before enrolling into the school or this was a general elective for them. I can confidently say that studying and working with  people who are older than me and have more experiences than me opened my eyes to unique and intriguing experiences. I got to learn from their work flows, work ethics and common knowledge from the IT field that was obtained from their experience working as interns during their gap years. The only thing that was unpleasant for me when working with them was the lack of transparency in their work, especially when working with Hoang. Since most of the time developing the chatbot with him, he didn’t assign me any tasks or collaborate with me to develop more functions for the chatbot. As a result, we only got the basic FAQ function for the chatbot without completing any else. This reflects perfectly on our Github log of activity, as most of the commits were done by Hoang. Furthermore, the scarce number of commits can also be explained for our main methods of communication and collaboration were through Messenger and Google Doc. Therefore, I can only feel nothing but regret since I wish for more opportunities to work together on Github for our project. However, despite limited time working on Github, we were still able to produce satisfactory results for our final assignment. Therefore, although I feel nothing but regret when thinking about the missed opportunities working together on Github for our chatbot, I still manage to learn to navigate my way when using Github and learn more about the workflow, basic work ethics when collaborating with people on Github.
            </p>
            <h3>4/ Thu Nguyen's Reflection</h3>
            <p>To reflect on what we have done, I deemed that most of our tasks during our project went well. It was good that we formed our team early and we were on the same page with our vision for the project as well as our working style since we had more time discussing what we want to do for the project. Luckily, our team members also come from diverse backgrounds that complement each other well. One thing I believe that could be improved is our scope management skill. As I mentioned, our team was formed very early and decided to create a lot of features for our chatbot. To support the chatbot, I suggested creating an onboarding flow to help accommodate the students alongside Botto. What I did not take into account was that the onboarding process would be too time consuming and not really support the main focus of our project because we had already agreed to create a Botto. In the end, since we were out of time, we decided to focus on the chatbot rather than building an onboarding flow. I also learned a lot in the group, especially with communication skills and technical knowledge. Thanks to this project, I now know how to create a chatbot, how it works, and how to create a simple website. Looking back, I believe that the activity log on github partially reflects our group's work on this assignment. This is mainly because we have been working on Google Docs and after finishing with our writings, our members will update the content to our website. As a result, although our github log of activity does not show many commits, our team still worked well and finished our assignment on time.
