    <h1> Team name explanation</h1>
        <p>Our team’s name is CFOB which C stands for creative, F – friendly, O – organized and B is the first letter of our product name – Botto. This name is the combination of our mutual characteristics, working style, and the name of our AI-powered FAQ Chatbot. In our group, Hoang Anh’s business-oriented ideas amalgamated with the other three technology enthusiasts' views sparked inventive and captivating ideas for the project. We work with a friendly, polite, and professional attitude so we aim to instill in Botto those similar qualities which align perfectly with RMIT students' expectations of a good companion.</p>
        <p>Our team always attempted to have deadlines, meetings, and groupwork well-organized to ensure optimal results from the project. These meticulous decision-making, strategy-planning, communicating, time-managing skills and the ability to work under pressure during each assignment not only benefit us within the scope of this project but for our future careers as well. We were actively finding each other during online session and forming a team immediately after the first meet-and-great, earlier than many others groups and finalized the project ideas at the end of week 1. This is proof of our team chemistry and spirits since the very beginning. </p>
        <p>Botto is a suitable name for our project. “Botto," its pronunciation directly suggests an association with robot, automation but still exudes traits of friendliness and cordiality. We unanimously agreed to combine all 4 elements as the group name to both celebrate the results we have achieved as a group and remind us to keep thriving and contributing in such manners. </p>
