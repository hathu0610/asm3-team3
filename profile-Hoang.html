    <h1> Team Profile/Hoang Nguyen</h1>
    <h3>1/ Personal Information</h3>
    <p>I am Nguyen Nhat Hoang (s3926555), a first-year student at RMIT Vietnam. Sports are indispensable to me because I absolutely appreciate the rivalry, teamwork, and dedication of the game. In fact, sports helped me fit in and introduced me to reliable friends while I was studying abroad. It was also during that time when I was in a Computer Science class that I had my first encounter with programming. Honestly, the coding challenges were so difficult, and I could not make sense of any of the jargon from my friends, yet those problems still enticed me to spend days trying to find out the solutions. Once I discovered the relationship between my favorite subject, math, and computer programming, I came to the realization that I must seek a professional career in Information Technology. Returning home amid the first COVID-19 outbreak, I took some time reflecting on my myself, my future plan, and my passion, then started an apprenticeship at Pancake Vietnam. During these 10 months, I have gained some knowledge about Flutter and Phoenix frameworks that Pancake uses to build their enterprise chatting, project managing app. What todays' computers can do is unimaginable 30 years ago, yet, I believe Artificial Intelligence and its application will push computers to breakthroughs that will beneficially impact everyone's live. With such belief in mind, I aspire to research and administer Artificial Intelligence here at RMIT.</p>

    <h3>2/ Career plan</h3>
    <p>Working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at VinBrain is appealing to me. VinBrainâ€™s mission in strengthening the global health system via AI/machine learning research and applications is the main reason why I aspire to be on their team. Though working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer also means taking up a lot of responsibilities and having to construct, test, and analyze large machine learning systems for speed and scalability optimization, I know that I will be able to develop myself and help many others at the same time. Moreover, with funding and other resources from a conglomerate as big as Vingroup, I am sure that I will be immersing myself in the latest technologies, emulating the brightest engineers in the industry, and working on the most iconic programs in the world.</p>
