    <h1> Overview/Topic</h1>
    <p>This project is the outcome of our group ideas in building a product to better RMIT students’ experience during their years at the school. With the set of questions, answers, and media materials collected from RMIT's official sites paired with our group members’ personal experience at RMIT, we plan on creating an FAQ chatbot powered by Artificial Intelligence. Not only will this chatbot benefit students by providing speedy responses to their questions, but also RMIT staff by reducing their work in answering repeated questions. This project helps escalate the satisfaction of students with school’s services and reduce labor costs for the school itself.</p>
        
        
    
    <p>Some of the crucial criterias when a student chooses a university are based on the service and education quality. The chatbot is, hence, designed to help departments like RMIT Connect channel their resource into taking better care of students and parents. While still meeting standards of a high-quality, international institution, the chatbot also provides intriguing insights about the university collected directly from its current students. By delivering immediate replies to students’ questions, this project helps boost RMIT new students' experience with school services and brings financial and branding benefits to RMIT. To be more specific, the impact of a 24/7 Chatbot is more than likely to result in an increase in students’ satisfaction and continuous savings for RMIT (Coforge 2021). With the bombardment of students’ inquiries at the beginning of every semester, it can be overwhelming for RMIT staff to take good care of all students. Therefore, by adopting technology assistance in their day-to-day job, and directing more of their time towards difficult inquiries, the staff could provide more exceptional services to students, parents, and faculty without having to repeatedly address straightforward questions. Additionally, with this chatbot, it will not be such a challenge to administer great service during weekends, after working hours, or off-peak hours anymore.
