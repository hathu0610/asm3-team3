    <h1> Overview/Topic</h1>
    <p>This project proposes our group ideas transmitting to the final products of offering a better experience for RMIT new students during their school years. With the set of questions collected from the RMIT website and our group members’ experiences, a FAQ chatbot is created to assist not only students with a quicker response to questions but also RMIT staff in reducing the amount workload which increase the satisfaction of students in school services and reduce labor costs for the school itself.
    </p>
    <p>Some of the vital elements when choosing a university are based on the service and education quality. To reach the standard of international studying like RMIT, FAQ chatbot provides one by one experience as well as the fast speed in responding to support RMIT’s new students better especially during high volume of asking questions at the beginning of the semester. This project not only helps RMIT new students to have the best experiences in using school services but also brings various benefits to RMIT itself. To be more specific, the impact in the development of Chatbot includes an increase in students’ satisfaction, the availability of 24/7, and the continuous saving for RMIT (Coforge 2021). With the increase of students’ inquiries when the semester starts, it can be overloaded for RMIT staff to respond to each student so by connecting with technology, taking up the recorded inquiries, questions from RMIT students, and chatbot interactions, and managing any undulation in demand during weekends, after working hours and off-peak hours are not a challenge anymore.
